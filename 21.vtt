00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.269
Episode 21, Elizabeth.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.430
Phoning Miki was always a long process.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.550
He had given me the number to his “direct line”, which went to the desk of

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.600
his assistant, who was normally half asleep or drunk - I couldn’t tell which.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.409
Then, the assistant would put me on hold for half an hour while he

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:29.490
fetched Miki from the golf course, the bowling alley, or wherever he was.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.259
“Hello, Elizabeth!

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:37.500
How lovely to hear from you!” he announced when I finally got him on the phone.

00:00:38.316 --> 00:00:42.106
“ I’ve been on hold for 40 minutes, Miki,” I said.

00:00:42.386 --> 00:00:43.766
“What were you doing?”

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.019
“ I just got married to five young women, Elizabeth.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.199
What do you think I was doing?” he asked.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.989
My face turned bright red, and I was glad Miki couldn’t see it.

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:04.389
“My darling, I can feel you blushing over the phone!” he said.

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:11.570
He was clearly having fun teasing me, but I wanted to press on with business.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.950
“I’m glad you’re…enjoying yourself, Miki.

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:22.740
You’ve had years of good stories in the press over here… and now we’re back to square one again.

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.400
Remember what I said about being careful?

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.140
Why on Earth did you marry five women?

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.729
And don’t tell me it’s because they’re all in love with you!”

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.499
Miki, as usual, turned on the charm, “They will be, perhaps, in time.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.990
Your media over there didn’t mention that they would be lifted out of poverty.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.100
All five are orphans and, trust me, they’re very happy about their new lives.”

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.690
“People are saying it’s because there are certain “rumours”.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.039
I think I know what one is about, but I’ve even heard one that you are gay,” I pressed.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.270
I was shocked when the line clicked dead.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.080
Had I hit a raw nerve?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.740
Touché.

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:18.690
But the phone rang again a moment later, and Miki was back on the line.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.200
“Since we are going to talk about sensitive matters, I

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.570
would prefer to use a more secure line,” he explained.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.920
“Your MI6 has eyes and ears everywhere.”

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.170
I rolled my eyes.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.760
“Miki, you were filmed wearing a military uniform and threatening to invade nearby countries.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.240
This is 2008 now.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.680
There’s a camera on every phone and you can’t stop people from seeing what’s going on.”

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.996
I could sense that Miki was unhappy with me pushing him on this.

00:02:56.276 --> 00:03:00.356
I knew he didn’t like me nagging, but I couldn’t help myself.

00:03:01.936 --> 00:03:07.396
“What would you expect me to do, Elizabeth?” he said in an exasperated voice.

00:03:07.576 --> 00:03:10.466
“I was just having fun at my wedding banquet.

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:16.856
Yes, I said some silly things – that’s what we do in Ankhazastan after a little drink.

00:03:17.166 --> 00:03:18.766
Is that a crime over there?

00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:20.636
Because here, it’s not.”

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:23.956
“Of course not,” I said.

00:03:24.176 --> 00:03:28.106
“If you have total power, the law is whatever you say it is.

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:33.166
Miki, you’re 35 years old, you’re acting ridiculous and

00:03:33.166 --> 00:03:37.816
you need to sort yourself out, then sort your country out.”

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:40.946
The line clicked dead.

00:03:41.546 --> 00:03:42.816
Would he call back?

00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:46.096
What would I do if he broke off all contact?

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:50.106
A minute passed and the phone rang.

00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:55.956
“Elizabeth, I… you’re right about me drinking too much.

00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:58.916
I should be more careful,” Miki said.

00:04:00.566 --> 00:04:05.186
I was so touched to see the vulnerable side of him, and I softened.

00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:07.826
“Thanks, Miki,” I replied.

00:04:08.356 --> 00:04:11.616
“And I do look forward to seeing you again soon.”

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:15.176
“Me too,” said Miki.
