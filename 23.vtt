Episode 23, George.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.230
As head of an international investment group, I tried

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.960
my best to avoid speaking to the media at all costs.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.500
But sometimes, there was just no avoiding it, and today was one of those days.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.950
I nodded to my assistant, took a deep breath and walked into the press

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.849
centre, where a mob of fifty or so journalists were already waiting.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.679
As soon as they saw me, the cameras started flashing and

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.020
the journalists immediately started barking questions.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.290
I sat down behind a row of microphones and held up my hand to quieten the hyenas.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.699
Then, I gave a short statement.

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:55.930
“Whatever we discover about how our investments have been used, I stand by the core

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.480
principle that the best way to help people who are oppressed is through investment.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.919
I’ll now take some questions.”

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.209
Sally Orlov from News at Eight stood up.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.790
“So, you admit that the people of Ankhazastan are oppressed?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.230
Previously, you told your investors that the country is on the right track…”

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.359
Damn, I thought to myself, I shouldn’t have used the word oppressed.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.690
“Well… er… I mean they are… er ‘oppressed’ in a way,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.790
by the unequal distribution of wealth, globally.”

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.780
“And are you still a close friend of Miki Unjonginiv?” Sally asked.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.309
“I am,” I answered hesitantly.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:49.950
A BBC reporter stood up.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.589
“Did you have any idea that the money you pumped into Ankhazastan was being

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.850
used to build chemical weapons in contravention of the Geneva Convention?”

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.880
I could hear the fake outrage in her voice – an old reporter’s trick.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.250
“Of course I had no idea,” I replied, matter of fact.

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.800
She pressed on, “I find that hard to believe – are you

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.189
saying that there was no accountability whatsoever…”

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.870
“No,” I interrupted, “I’m not saying…”

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.810
The reporter cut me off.

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.459
“The BBC has come into possession of documents that describe

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.350
‘special payments’ being made in the airport project.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.349
Please explain that.”

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.979
I sighed.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.500
“There are always what we call ‘miscellaneous costs’ in any project.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.970
They could be licensing costs that we hadn’t expected, for example.”

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.810
“In the HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars?” the reporter demanded.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.130
How could I answer her question?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.570
The truth was, I had screwed up . Of course I knew about the special payments, but

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.170
I had thought they were bribes – money paid “under the table” to speed things up.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.640
It was normal for us to pay bribes in countries like Ankhazastan.

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.890
It was the way of the world.

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.849
There was no way to answer truthfully without making

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.240
myself look bad or revealing the skeletons in my closet.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.500
“Thank you everyone,” I said, standing up, “but I’ll have to cut short this press conference

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.190
so that my lawyers can examine these new documents… and verify whether they are real.”

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.280
The BBC reporter frowned at this last statement.

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:54.310
I walked out of the room the same way I had walked in – with journalists

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.899
shouting questions and a million cameras flashing in my face.
