00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.330
Episode 26, George.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.570
Eventually, we came to a small road leading out of the city and into the countryside.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.690
It was full of potholes and in abysmal condition.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.549
“Actually, we have new highway now, thanks to you, George, but there

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.750
is many checkpoints, so we take old roads,” Haydiniv explained.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.589
“This time, you see the real Ankhazastan.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.990
I show you Borokov Prison and I introduce you to workers from chemical weapon facility.”

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.269
As we drove towards Borokov, we began to run low on petrol.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.400
We passed by the same petrol station that we had used on our last trip… but it was now closed.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.490
“I hope we don’t run out of petrol,” I told Haydiniv.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.260
“I hope so, too,” said Haydiniv.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.990
“I have extra canisters in the back, but every day more and more petrol stations getting closed.”

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.960
“And there are not many cars on the road,” I observed.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.550
We had only seen a handful of other vehicles in an hour of driving.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.479
“To buy a car in Ankhazastan is ten years of salary for normal worker.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.360
And you can only buy Soviet-era reject cars,” Haydiniv explained.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:42.423
Elizabeth spoke up, “So… how did you afford this one, Haydiniv?” “This one?” Haydiniv asked.

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:43.953
“I stole this one.”

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:47.693
Elizabeth and I looked at each other.

00:01:48.573 --> 00:01:54.323
I wished we had a more reliable guide, but Haydiniv was at least street-smart.

00:01:54.953 --> 00:02:00.123
He had been telling us about conditions in Ankhazastan, but I didn’t trust his words.

00:02:00.793 --> 00:02:04.303
I had told him I wanted to SEE for myself.

00:02:06.603 --> 00:02:11.373
We turned off the main road and started driving up a steep hill.

00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:15.743
“Where are we going, exactly?” I asked.

00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:21.203
“To SEE for yourself,” was all Haydiniv would say.

00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:29.083
After about fifteen minutes of driving, we reached the top of the steep hill, which

00:02:29.103 --> 00:02:34.823
gave an excellent panoramic view of the small towns and villages in the valley below.

00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:42.383
Haydiniv pulled the car over, reached into the glove compartment and pulled out some binoculars.

00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:48.833
Outside the car, he focused the binoculars and handed them to me.

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:55.053
I looked through them and saw the small village we had visited on our last trip.

00:02:55.763 --> 00:03:00.703
I could even see the café near the clock tower – it was closed down now.

00:03:02.013 --> 00:03:04.543
“To the right,” Haydiniv commanded.

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:06.223
“See the school?”

00:03:07.603 --> 00:03:12.343
“Yes, it’s closed down and abandoned,” I said.

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:15.903
“Okay, look further right.”

00:03:16.773 --> 00:03:21.503
Beyond the poverty of the village, there was a massive shiny

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:25.993
new building, with men with machine guns patrolling the walls.

00:03:26.863 --> 00:03:27.563
A prison!

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:34.253
I remembered how, on our last trip, the villagers denied there was a prison nearby.

00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:37.583
I wish we had pushed them harder.

00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:42.863
“More further to the right,” Haydiniv said, and I did so.

00:03:44.553 --> 00:03:47.523
“What do you see, George?” asked Elizabeth.

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:52.723
I replied, “It’s some kind of factory.

00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:54.993
It looks newly built.

00:03:55.873 --> 00:03:57.253
There’s a lot of activity.”

00:03:58.493 --> 00:04:04.283
“That’s place where they research and construct chemical weapons,” Haydiniv said.

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:06.083
“Nerve gas.”

00:04:07.413 --> 00:04:10.003
“But why is it so close to the prison?

00:04:10.823 --> 00:04:12.263
It’s virtually next door.”

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:14.993
“Why do you think?

00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:17.893
You tell me,” said Haydiniv.

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:20.293
I knew the answer.

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:23.183
The prisoners were the workers.

00:04:23.793 --> 00:04:26.553
That was why the secret never got out.

00:04:27.063 --> 00:04:31.033
And prisoners couldn’t complain about safety conditions.

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:36.558
All paid for with money arranged by me.

00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:42.586
Nerve gas didn’t only kill soldiers; it killed civilians.

00:04:43.446 --> 00:04:46.446
A cruel and senseless death.

00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:52.846
Once again, Miki had made a fool out of me.

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:59.316
I wish I had never met Miki Unjonginiv.
