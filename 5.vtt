Episode 5, George.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.650
In the five years that followed Hemsworth College, Elizabeth

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.650
and I completed our degrees and began our working lives.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.159
Miki never went to university; he flew straight back to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.160
Ankhazastan and began his rule, leaving us no way to contact him.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.669
This was 1994.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.569
The Internet was still a new thing and we couldn’t

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.119
just exactly email him or message him on Facebook.

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:40.239
We expected to follow his progress on the news, but Ankhazastan hardly ever made the news.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.530
There was the odd story about a new dam being built

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.929
or their national day celebrations… and that was it.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.660
Then, one day and quite out of the blue, I received a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.239
letter – in a very formal envelope with an Ankhaz stamp on it.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.819
Miki!

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.609
Excitedly, I tore it open to find a simple message written

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.740
on a piece of paper from “the Office of the President”.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.360
It said:

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.170
Greetings George!

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.759
I really miss you guys.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.100
Fly to Ankhazastan.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.860
Come to the Presidential Palace and present this invitation to see me anytime.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.570
Don’t be shy.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.300
Come!

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.680
Love,

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.890
Miki

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.630
The next day, I met Elizabeth for a coffee and showed her the card.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.720
She had received one too.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.759
“Should we go?” she asked.

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:51.522
“ I think we should,” I replied.

00:01:51.972 --> 00:01:55.312
“We haven’t seen or heard from that bugger for five years now.

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:57.922
Lord knows what he’s up to over there.

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.022
And we’ll get to visit the ‘Presidential Palace’.

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:03.202
It sounds pretty glamorous.”

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:09.902
“The way the invitation is written, he expects us to show up at his doorstep.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:16.172
I mean… what if he’s having dinner with his mum or something?” mused Elizabeth.

00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:18.452
I laughed.

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:20.572
“It seems sincere, though.

00:02:21.172 --> 00:02:23.782
And the three of us were really close once.

00:02:24.802 --> 00:02:25.762
Let’s just do it.”

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:30.502
“How about the end of next month?” asked Elizabeth.

00:02:31.822 --> 00:02:32.802
I nodded my head.

00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:34.062
“Sure.”

00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:36.721
“ I tell you what I’ll do,” she said.

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:38.951
“I’ll go get the tickets right now.

00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:41.991
I’ll put them on my card, and you can pay me back later.

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:44.271
I’ll find out how we can get visas.

00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:45.761
Wanna join me?”

00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:50.851
“I have a meeting at four,” I said, shaking my head, “but

00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:53.641
I’ll reschedule my calendar and make time for the trip.”

00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.711
We both stared out of the window for a few moments.

00:02:58.408 --> 00:02:59.978
We would be going to Ankhazastan.

00:03:01.628 --> 00:03:04.218
What an amazing adventure it would be!
