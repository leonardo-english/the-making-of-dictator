Episode 13, George.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.029
One of the reasons that I felt close to Miki was that we were in somewhat of the same situation.

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.009
Miki had inherited a country and I had inherited something myself.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.320
You see, about a week after I attended the protest, my father suddenly died of a heart

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:34.100
attack and I became the new CEO of Whiterock Investments Limited, our family investment firm.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.280
Well, it wasn’t just “family”.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:47.199
We managed almost $25 billion in assets, which we, now I, I guess, invested around the world.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.869
It was only a few days later that Miki called…

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.420
surprising me, since we usually corresponded by email.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.570
“George,” he said in his usual charming way, “first of all, my deep condolences

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.359
on the death of your father and secondly, congratulations on your new role!

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.589
I bet you’re incredibly busy.”

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:14.710
“Thanks, Miki,” I replied.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.940
“You’re probably one of the few people who understands what it’s like.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.450
‘Heavy is the head that wears the crown’, you once said.”, hoping he’d be impressed by my memory.

00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:28.683
He ignored it and changed the subject.

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:34.443
“And you took a trip to the Ankhaz Embassy last week, I hear.”

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:37.743
My mood darkened.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:41.903
“Miki… how did you know that?

00:01:42.953 --> 00:01:44.863
You’re not having me followed, are you?”

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:50.003
“Oh, my goodness, no!” Miki laughed.

00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:55.463
“Our ambassador in London is General Nabikiv, who you met when you were here.

00:01:56.113 --> 00:01:59.623
He reported to me on the protest and said he recognised

00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:03.743
you in the crowd, talking to some of our local supporters.”

00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:07.513
I told myself not to be so paranoid.

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:12.183
Of course, all ambassadors need to send these kinds of reports.

00:02:14.123 --> 00:02:18.733
However, it was a bit embarrassing to be noticed there.

00:02:19.703 --> 00:02:22.063
I hoped Miki wouldn’t get the wrong impression.

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:29.073
“Anyway,” Miki continued, “your company has something called a Global

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:35.123
Development Initiative Fund… and I have a country that needs development.

00:02:36.303 --> 00:02:37.603
Do you see where I’m going with this?

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:42.763
We’re building a dam, a new airport and a beach resort… all

00:02:42.813 --> 00:02:46.353
of these projects could be great investments for Whiterock.

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:49.923
We still have oil fields that we haven’t tapped.”

00:02:51.553 --> 00:02:52.473
I was shocked.

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:55.623
I hadn’t expected a business proposal.

00:02:57.263 --> 00:03:03.253
“Miki,” I said, “You know that you’ve been generating negative stories in the media here.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:10.183
It will be a hard sell to convince my people to agree to invest in Ankhazastan.”

00:03:11.753 --> 00:03:18.733
“But the final decision is up to you, as the CEO and majority shareholder,” Miki pointed out.

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:22.113
“Yes,” I agreed.

00:03:23.073 --> 00:03:27.103
“Like a…dictator,” Miki said.

00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:31.423
I could almost hear a grin coming over his face.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:39.473
“Well, I wouldn’t quite put it that way…,” I replied, but my mind was working rapidly.

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:44.143
Whiterock was the 12th biggest corporation of its type, and

00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:48.013
our performance had been quite lacklustre the past few years.

00:03:49.173 --> 00:03:54.953
Maybe… just maybe… Miki’s idea could boost us into

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:59.393
the top ten… and make huge profits at the same time.

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:04.613
“You know what, Miki,” I said, “You’re right.

00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:07.883
These really could be solid investments.”

00:04:09.263 --> 00:04:13.198
“Then fly over here and let’s talk,” said Miki.

00:04:14.023 --> 00:04:18.643
I thought about this for a moment and said “The investments would

00:04:18.643 --> 00:04:22.323
need to be connected to some kind of positive social change.

00:04:22.893 --> 00:04:25.473
Or at least seen to be connected to change.”

00:04:26.653 --> 00:04:29.873
And Miki replied, “No problem, George!

00:04:30.113 --> 00:04:30.853
No problem.”

00:04:31.683 --> 00:04:35.223
Perhaps this was exactly what we both needed.
