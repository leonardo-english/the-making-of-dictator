Episode 9, George.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.790
After spending the day with Miki, he insisted that we spend the night in

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.910
the Presidential Palace instead of our shabby hotel, and we agreed eagerly.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.550
Anyway, after drinking way too much vodka, we just wanted to flop down into a comfortable bed.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.430
And the beds in the palace were a big step up from the ones in Hotel Paradiskiv.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.950
I didn’t see a single cockroach!

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.510
The morning after, Miki had said that he wanted to spend more time

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.160
with us, but he was hosting the Prime Minister of Belarus for a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.769
three-day meeting, so we had breakfast and then went off in his limo.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.720
Once in the limo, I asked Elizabeth her thoughts.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.790
“I don’t know what to think,” she said.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.729
“He really is the same old Miki; he’s fun and easygoing, he's intellectual and charming.

00:01:10.523 --> 00:01:13.553
But… look at this…”

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.530
She motioned with her hand to the rows of banners lining the streets,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.330
each one proudly displaying Miki’s face above a propaganda slogan.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.650
“But he’s an old friend,” Elizabeth continued, “and I want to give him the benefit of the doubt.”

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.070
Once back at the hotel, we instructed the limo to wait outside

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.310
while we packed our things for the airport and freshened up.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.900
But when I opened the door to my hotel room, I got a huge surprise.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.440
A scruffy man was sitting on my bed.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.580
He was wearing a shabby green jacket and had a paranoid look about him.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.560
“Who the hell are you?” I asked, annoyed at his presence in my room.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.880
“And how did you get in here?”

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.700
The man just put his finger to his lips and picked up the telephone next to my bed.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.420
Turning it over, he showed me an electronic device attached underneath.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.100
He pointed towards the bathroom.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.970
I understood – he wanted to talk in there.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.080
Once I was inside the cramped bathroom, with this

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.150
unpleasant-smelling man, he turned on the water tap.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.140
I hoped he might have a wash, but I suppose it was to obscure our conversation.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.600
“I’m Haydiniv,” he told me in a whisper.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.770
“I was once the leader of a group opposed to Miki’s rule.”

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.930
“That makes you an anarchist or a communist, then,” I said,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.650
speaking at a normal volume and refusing to play his silly game.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.850
“No,” he insisted.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.640
“A true democrat.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.870
If you want anarchists or communists, go to Oxford University.”

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.550
I rolled my eyes.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.250
“What do you want?”

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.980
“If you want to know the real truth about Ankhazastan, listen to me.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.360
Not Miki’s version of truth.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.950
He is cruel and sadistic man, like his father… worse.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.190
He talks about reform just to look good in front of Western friends.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.160
Meanwhile…”

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.450
A loud knock on the door made the man jump in panic.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.150
With amazing agility, he pushed a piece of paper into my

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.610
hand, opened the bathroom window and climbed out and away.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.220
I looked out to see him scuttling down the drainpipe.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.940
The paper he had given me held a phone number.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.330
When I opened the door, Elizabeth was standing there.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.610
“I heard voices coming from your room,” she said.
