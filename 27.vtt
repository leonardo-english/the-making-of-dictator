Episode 27, Elizabeth.

00:00:05.039 --> 00:00:09.739
In the car on the way back to the capital, we drove in silence.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.949
Haydiniv looked smug.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.709
He had made his point.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.359
George simply frowned and stared out the window.

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.399
I could see that he was lost as to what to do next.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.819
And me?

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.029
I was desperately hoping to think of a way to turn the situation around.

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:36.959
Miki had sold me a dream and I wasn’t willing yet to let go of it.

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:41.399
What would we say when we saw Miki again?

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:46.949
As it turned out, we had even bigger problems.

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:53.509
As we got nearer the capital, Ankhaz, Haydiniv swore and slammed on the brakes.

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.839
“What’s wrong?” I asked.

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.369
“Roadblock!

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:04.349
But… why here?” he exclaimed.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:09.959
Sure enough, there was a roadblock manned by soldiers about 200 metres ahead.

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:19.059
Haydiniv turned the car around to drive back the other way, but the soldiers saw

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:24.539
him doing this and two of them immediately jumped into a jeep and gave chase.

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:31.199
I looked at the dashboard and I realised that we were going to run out of petrol very soon.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.129
“Haydiniv, we don’t have enough petrol,” I pointed out.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:38.429
“There’s no point trying to…”

00:01:38.622 --> 00:01:43.902
Haydiniv slammed on the brakes again, causing me to hit my head on the headrest.

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:48.902
Then, he jumped out of the car and ran into the nearest field.

00:01:49.472 --> 00:01:57.212
He was heading towards the trees, but he was old and slow, and the treeline was too far.

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:02.992
The jeep pulled up next to us, and the soldiers got out.

00:02:03.472 --> 00:02:11.982
One of them had a sighted rifle and he took aim at the fleeing Haydiniv… and pulled the trigger.

00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:20.662
I turned away, but I knew what had happened… they didn’t bother taking a second shot.

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:27.282
As the soldiers approached us, George and I pulled out our passports

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:31.172
and the letters we had from Miki guaranteeing our protection.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:36.942
But the soldiers grabbed our documents and threw them to the ground.

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:42.302
One of them produced a pistol and motioned with it for us to get into the jeep.

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:46.752
How could they ignore our letters from Miki?

00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:48.592
What was going on?

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:51.462
What was going to happen to us?
