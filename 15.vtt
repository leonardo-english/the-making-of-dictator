Episode 15, Elizabeth.

00:00:04.145 --> 00:00:07.745
There was still no direct flight from London to Ankhaz.

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:13.175
This meant that, once again, we needed to fly to Vladivostok

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:16.085
first and then catch a connecting flight from there.

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:21.185
George and I were sitting at Heathrow Airport, waiting

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:24.625
for our flight and dreading the long journey ahead.

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:28.475
George seemed more gung-ho about the whole thing than I

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:32.085
did, even though I was looking forward to seeing Miki.

00:00:33.635 --> 00:00:38.525
“What we have here,” he told me, “is a chance to help shape history.

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:44.765
If Miki is heading down the wrong path… and it’s still an ‘if’ to me… if he

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.895
is heading down the wrong path, then we have a chance to set him straight.

00:00:50.455 --> 00:00:53.815
“But I trust him and he needs us,” he added.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:57.165
“We’ll be doing the right thing; I’m sure of it.”

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:01.745
I nodded my head and thought about it for a minute.

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:08.455
George was right – we’d have a chance to shape history, from the sidelines.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:12.805
And perhaps we could save our friend… from himself.

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:16.215
Just then, my phone dinged.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.535
A notification.

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:23.035
“You’d better check it,” George said, “We’re boarding in just a moment.”

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.455
It was a text message from one of my coworkers.

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:35.885
READ THIS it said in capital letters, underneath a link to a social media page.

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:45.435
I clicked on the link and the headline jumped out at me: MAN ESCAPES FROM ANKHAZASTAN PRISON HELL.

00:01:46.965 --> 00:01:50.025
“Look at this,” I told George and showed it to him.

00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:55.285
A political dissident escaped from a prison in Ankhazastan and managed

00:01:55.335 --> 00:02:00.255
to flee the country on Friday by sneaking onto a Russian transport plane.

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:08.190
He then turned up at the Swedish Embassy in Moscow, asking for safe passage to Europe.

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.985
Photos of the man show his face beaten black and blue.

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:16.655
His crime, according to the man, was snatching a bag

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:19.915
of potatoes to prevent his family from going hungry.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:25.981
It was accompanied by a picture of a man who had obviously been beaten up.

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:29.138
At the bottom of the article, there was a button that

00:02:29.138 --> 00:02:33.518
said “read more” with a link and I started to click on it.

00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:35.645
“ Wait,” said George.

00:02:36.015 --> 00:02:37.585
“Look carefully at the link.

00:02:38.085 --> 00:02:40.245
BBCNEWSNOW.UK.

00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:42.475
That’s a fake news website.

00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:45.510
The real site is BBC.CO.UK.”

00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:48.601
“ Ah, good spot,” I said.

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:52.091
“It’s a fake website, but is the news fake?

00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:54.401
I mean, that’s a real photo.”

00:02:55.931 --> 00:03:00.821
“I’m not sure what to think,” George said, “but I trust Miki.”

00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:10.871
“The Russians have an old saying,” I told George, “Doveryay, no proveryay - trust, but verify.”

00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:16.805
However, before we could verify the news, our flight began boarding.

00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:23.428
There was no internet access on the flight and no wifi signal when we got to Vladivostok airport.

00:03:23.838 --> 00:03:28.448
With heavy hearts, we boarded the flight that would take us to Anhazastan.
