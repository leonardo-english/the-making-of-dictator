Episode 11, Elizabeth.

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:08.066
I was sitting in a quiet café just off Covent Garden in

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:11.516
London when George slipped into the seat opposite me.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.616
“Have you heard?” he asked without even saying hello.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.259
“ About Miki?” I said.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.199
“Of course.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.379
He’s been all over the headlines.”

00:00:23.253 --> 00:00:28.163
George looked down for a few moments and asked, “It’s been four years now.

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:30.023
Have you kept in touch with him?”

00:00:31.593 --> 00:00:34.533
“I’ve emailed him every month,” I replied.

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:37.443
“But we’ve never spoken about politics.

00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:43.603
You know, he likes to talk about French wine and ask my opinion on things he read in Nietzsche.”

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:47.983
“Same here,” George laughed dryly.

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:53.923
“In my last email, I recommended a good Sancerre and told him to read Marcus Aurelius instead.

00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:57.383
Do you think it’s as bad as the papers make out?

00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:03.012
They've been calling him a ‘strongman’; now it’s ‘dictator’ and ‘authoritarian’.

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:04.912
Surely they’re exaggerating...”

00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:12.132
“What I think,” I said, “is that we should make another trip over there as soon as we can.

00:01:12.662 --> 00:01:18.892
This time, plan it properly, stay for a while and ask Miki to see more of the country.

00:01:19.302 --> 00:01:23.502
See if it’s really the repressive regime that the newspapers describe.

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:28.212
After all, the journalists writing about it haven’t even been there.

00:01:28.682 --> 00:01:32.832
They’re publishing second-hand information from angry dissidents.”

00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:39.232
“And if we find that it really is repressive?” George asked.

00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:42.141
“ We’re Miki’s friends,” I told him.

00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:44.911
“It’s our responsibility to talk to him.

00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:47.651
I mean, we should at least try.

00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:54.481
He’s probably surrounded by ‘yes-men’ and never hears anyone correcting or guiding him.

00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:56.221
He needs us.

00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:58.721
We’re all he’s got, when you think about it”

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:01.014
George nodded thoughtfully.

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:04.244
Then he brought out a newspaper clipping to show me.

00:02:04.794 --> 00:02:10.774
It talked about a protest that would be held outside the Ankhaz embassy the following day.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:16.324
The protest was called ‘End Totalitarianism In Ankhazastan’.

00:02:17.894 --> 00:02:21.194
“I’m going to go to this protest,” George said, “and

00:02:21.204 --> 00:02:24.974
find out exactly what people are saying about Miki.”
