Episode 7, George.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:12.889
I woke up in Hotel Paradiskiv – the Paradise Hotel – to find a cockroach crawling over my pillow.

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:17.876
The worst thing was that I was in no way surprised to find it there.

00:00:19.376 --> 00:00:21.966
I washed and met Elizabeth in the lobby.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.746
“ Let’s give breakfast a miss,” she suggested.

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:32.016
“I’m guessing the hygiene in the kitchen here is as bad as the hygiene in the rooms.”

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.386
“Good call,” I said.

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:38.496
“Let’s head straight out to the Presidential Palace.

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:40.706
Maybe we’ll get fed there.”

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:47.436
We only needed to wait half an hour for a taxi – better than the airport at least.

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:53.186
And it only took one centimetre of notes to reach the palace, a twenty-minute trip.

00:00:54.396 --> 00:01:00.336
On the way there, we passed more billboards of Miki, each displaying a slogan.

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:04.196
He still looked young, handsome and confident.

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:08.346
We wondered whether he would be the same Miki we’d known at Hemsworth.

00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:11.946
Miki, our friend.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:17.146
The city of Ankhaz was gloomy and depressing.

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:24.386
It was one large slum, full of Soviet-era tower blocks that had seen better days.

00:01:25.096 --> 00:01:28.156
The people looked depressed and downtrodden.

00:01:28.916 --> 00:01:31.356
Miki was the president of this?

00:01:32.216 --> 00:01:35.896
The tinge of jealousy I was feeling started to fade away.

00:01:37.446 --> 00:01:41.706
As we neared the palace, though, we noticed a change.

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:47.026
The streets were clean, there were nice-looking shops and cafes.

00:01:48.516 --> 00:01:54.756
There were also soldiers everywhere, the place was teeming with people in military gear.

00:01:56.246 --> 00:01:58.676
Finally, we reached the palace.

00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:04.106
It was a huge building that dominated everything around it.

00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:12.376
Past the gold-plated outer gates, there was a huge statue of an eagle crushing a smaller bird.

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:18.756
The taxi dropped us off outside the inner gates, still a few hundred metres

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:23.536
from the palace doors, and we presented our letters to the soldiers guarding it.

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:28.546
The letter caused quite a kerfuffle, with the soldiers

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:32.106
arguing about it amongst themselves for several minutes.

00:02:33.296 --> 00:02:35.756
Finally, one of them spoke to us.

00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:40.696
“You are… politician?” he asked.

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:42.896
“No,” I said.

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:44.206
“Friends.”

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:46.266
“Journalist?

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:47.666
Newspaper?”

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:50.696
“No,” I repeated.

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:52.426
“Friends.”

00:02:54.136 --> 00:02:55.906
He stared at us for a moment.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.486
“Wait,” he said, finally.

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:04.376
We waited for ten minutes and nothing happened.

00:03:05.156 --> 00:03:07.986
Were they waiting for us to get bored and go home?

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:12.406
Finally, Elizabeth had a brainwave.

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:16.646
“I brought some old photos of us and Miki at school.

00:03:17.156 --> 00:03:18.046
Let me show them.”

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:24.286
And she took out a photograph of the three of us sitting on the lawn outside Hemsworth.

00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:29.386
When she showed it to the soldiers, it jolted them into action.

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:33.566
The senior one briefly scolded the two others before

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:37.306
personally escorting us to the main door of the palace.

00:03:38.546 --> 00:03:43.026
The letter and the photo got us past the guards at the door, past the

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:48.996
security inside and finally past the security on the top floor where

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:55.256
we found ourselves seated on plush sofas surrounded by marble and gold.

00:03:56.456 --> 00:04:00.506
“I’m General Nabikiv,” a man introduced himself.

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:03.906
“Allow me to get you some tea and breakfast.

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:08.976
President Miki is bowling, but he’ll be back in about half an hour.”

00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:13.016
“Bowling?” Elizabeth looked at me.

00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:16.156
I knew what she was thinking.

00:04:17.016 --> 00:04:22.686
In a country falling to bits, wouldn’t he have more important things to do?
