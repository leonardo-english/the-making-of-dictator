Episode 18, Elizabeth.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.070
I strode into Miki’s office, and there he was, leaning

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.510
against his huge solid oak desk, looking as youthful as ever.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.570
“I see you charmed George into those investments,” I noted.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.370
“I suppose you think you can charm me, too.”

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.570
Miki’s face immediately broke into a warm smile.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:38.290
“Would this help?” he asked, passing me a glass of wine, “It’s a 1972 Chateauneuf-du-Pape.”

00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:44.925
“ Perhaps,” I said, taking the wine, “ but we're here drinking a hundred pound

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:51.198
bottle of wine while people are out there starving… for food and for freedoms.”

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:59.445
“ This one’s actually closer to £500,” Miki noted, a sly grin coming over his face.

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:02.825
He grew more serious.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:09.765
“Elizabeth, if I want to allow more freedoms, I need to develop the country.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:13.895
George has agreed to help, but nobody will invest if there are

00:01:13.895 --> 00:01:18.855
continuous negative stories about Ankhazastan in the global press.”

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:26.515
“Miki,” I said, softening my tone a little, “I’m scared that the stories are true.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.765
They say that you’re a dictator.

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.698
They say that people are tortured in your prisons.

00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:35.968
Miki… it hurts me to ask you this… but are you

00:01:35.968 --> 00:01:39.698
becoming something you promised me you would never be?”

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:44.558
Miki drained his glass and set it down on the desk.

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:49.688
He said, “I’m a man who likes the finer things in life,

00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:54.218
and I’m a man in charge of a country where life is tough.

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:59.948
But I am passionately trying to make life better for my people.

00:02:00.278 --> 00:02:06.568
I’m no dictator and I never will be”, he said, looking me directly in the eyes.

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:15.518
It felt good to hear Miki say this with such authority and, for the moment, my doubts disappeared.

00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:20.458
“Then, Miki, where do all of these stories come from?

00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:24.618
I said, Before we left London, there was a story…”

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:26.525
Miki held up his hand.

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:32.057
“Elizabeth, imagine if only negative stories were reported about the UK.

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:34.747
The country would look very different.

00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:37.877
There were riots in a UK prison last month.

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:42.487
What is it…28 per cent of children are living in poverty?

00:02:42.687 --> 00:02:45.247
Tens of thousands of people live on the streets.

00:02:45.777 --> 00:02:50.207
A disabled man was beaten to death in police custody last year.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:55.047
Imagine if these were the only stories we ever heard about the UK.

00:02:55.597 --> 00:03:01.167
Everyone would say it was a cruel and unfair country that oppresses its citizens.”

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:03.937
I nodded my head.

00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:09.447
Miki had always had a way with words and I remembered how he had led the

00:03:09.447 --> 00:03:14.327
debating team at Hemsworth, even with English as his second language.

00:03:14.687 --> 00:03:18.587
But, he was right, the media really was biased.

00:03:19.087 --> 00:03:22.357
I should know, PR is my game, after all.

00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:28.557
“I can carry out a public relations campaign for you, Miki,” I said,

00:03:28.897 --> 00:03:34.117
“and I can get positive stories about Ankhazastan in the media and on

00:03:34.117 --> 00:03:39.607
the Internet… even written into movie scripts, but I have one condition.

00:03:40.697 --> 00:03:44.757
I will do this if you let George and me travel around Ankhazastan

00:03:45.387 --> 00:03:50.397
and see things for ourselves – no guys in uniform, no driver.”

00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:55.617
Miki smiled and refilled both of our glasses with wine.

00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:57.907
“Of course!” he said happily.

00:03:58.247 --> 00:04:00.457
“But I also have a condition.

00:04:01.057 --> 00:04:06.391
You will see a very poor country… don’t see it for what it is now.

00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:10.301
See it for what it can become five years from now.”

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:15.381
We drank some wine and I relaxed in his company.

00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.181
He refilled the glasses once again.

00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:24.921
As he passed me the wine, our fingers touched, and his hand lingered.

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:30.021
He moved towards me, expectantly, but… I turned my head.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.069
“ Miki, no, I…”, I said, putting my hand up to stop his advances.

00:04:36.682 --> 00:04:40.462
“ Of course, forgive me,” he replied, hanging his head.

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:49.722
It was a moment I had been waiting twenty years for, but when it came, everything had changed.

00:04:50.448 --> 00:04:55.378
Miki was no longer the innocent son-of-some-random-country’s-leader;

00:04:55.798 --> 00:05:00.028
he was the President of Ankhazastan and my future client.

00:05:00.518 --> 00:05:04.088
What’s more, I was to be married in a few months.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.080
No, no and no, I told myself.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.450
This was business, pure and simple.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.010
I needed to keep it that way.
