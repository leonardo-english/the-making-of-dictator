Episode 30, Miki.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.620
When they asked what I wanted in my prison cell, – which is actually one of the rooms in

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.320
the Presidential Palace – I asked for a wine cabinet stocked monthly with fine French wines,

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.410
books by my favourite philosophers and a computer with an uncensored Internet connection.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.869
“Prison” is quite comfortable, and, in fact, it has been good for me.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.619
I’ve had time to reflect on my time in power and think about the mistakes I made.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:40.180
Yes, if I have another chance, I will do things differently.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.079
After a month of imprisonment, my mind is now, in fact, very clear.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.860
I asked the usurper President Topov to release my old

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.060
friends George and Elizabeth and to bring them to me.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.790
They came to visit me in my cell and we drank some

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.320
Alsatian Riesling together and discussed Voltaire.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.703
I told them that I hope they will one day forgive me and that

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.860
I should never have allowed them to be mixed up in all of this.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.060
I also did something George had suggested many years ago – I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.450
signed up for online degree courses in Economics, Law and Politics.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.289
What I learn will certainly be useful when I get free.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.860
Speaking of which, President Topov’s subservient court

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.550
sentenced me to life imprisonment under house arrest.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.130
[laughs] They should have sentenced me to death… from their point of view, I mean.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.210
Because I have an ace up my sleeve, and I don’t plan to be in this so-called prison for long.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:57.410
When I married my five wives, many thought that it was because I needed a son to take over from me.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.529
No, no, I did it because I COULD.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.259
Most people can never understand absolute power.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.310
The truth is, I already have a son.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.040
Soon before leaving England, I got one of the Hemsworth

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.140
girls pregnant, and my father helped to hush it up.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.459
My son grew up in London receiving monthly payments

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.900
from me and being looked after by a distant relative.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.640
Not even the Ankhaz embassy knew about him.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.670
The Western media has sometimes accused me of short-term thinking.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.940
But for years now, my son and I have discussed “Plan B” – what to do if there’s a coup.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.170
How to return to Ankhazastan, fund a populist political party and eventually

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.980
seize control… only revealing that he is my son when the time is right.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.580
My son is a remarkably astute boy, and he knows many things that Topov

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.070
doesn’t know – hidden funds, sleeper agents, secret locations of heavy

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.579
weapons, contacts of people in Armagnia who are willing to help us and so on.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:22.990
Mikitiv is now seventeen, but he’ll be eighteen next week and it’ll be time.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.429
In fact, he’s just sent me a short email.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.509
Dear Dad,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.339
It’s me, Mikitiv.

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:33.420
Hold tight.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.620
Plan B is underway….
