00:00:00.878 --> 00:00:02.288
Episode four.

00:00:02.558 --> 00:00:03.138
Miki

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:09.988
It was graduation day at Hemsworth College and things were looking good.

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:16.168
My grades were fantastic and I had made some excellent friends and future contacts.

00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:20.318
There was some messy business with a girl I had a fling

00:00:20.318 --> 00:00:24.668
with, Alice, but my father had helped me to sort that out.

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:27.295
I wouldn’t be seeing her anymore.

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:31.975
And, best of all, that left me single again!

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:37.665
I would be having dinner with Elizabeth tomorrow night at her favourite restaurant.

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:42.945
Then, we’d both see George on Saturday for a final farewell to Hemsworth.

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.755
But just as I was making my way to the auditorium for the

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:52.175
graduation rehearsal, I received news of a phone call from home.

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:57.795
I took it in the Headmaster’s study, expecting to hear my father’s voice.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:01.505
But instead, it was General Topov.

00:01:02.055 --> 00:01:04.585
“Your father’s dead,” he said unceremoniously.

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:05.885
“Wh… what?” I stammered.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:13.395
His emotionless tone of voice had thrown me off guard.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:20.485
“He was poisoned,” Topov continued, “and you need to return to Ankhazastan immediately.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.975
A driver will be arriving within twenty minutes.

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:24.955
Pack.”

00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:29.485
My emotions flooded me… but I pushed them aside.

00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:32.125
“The graduation is tonight, Topov.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.145
At least let me stay for that.

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:37.255
In fact, I’m in charge now, aren’t I?

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:40.325
I can stay for the graduation if I want to.”

00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:46.135
“Let me remind you that you’re not yet eighteen, Miki,” he replied.

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:49.575
“Until then, I’m in charge of your affairs.

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:52.055
Pack, now.

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:55.195
And you need to start acting like a leader.”

00:01:56.685 --> 00:02:00.305
I put the phone down and sat with my head in my hands.

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:07.435
I felt… no great sadness for my father’s passing, but sad that I couldn’t

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:12.185
go to Harvard and the fear of running a country before I was ready.

00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:15.195
I would be eighteen in three weeks.

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:18.705
Start acting like a leader, Topov had said.

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:21.295
George and Elizabeth!

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:24.955
Forget packing, I had clothes in Ankhazastan.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:27.995
I needed to say goodbye to my friends.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.695
I found them together near the auditorium.

00:02:32.175 --> 00:02:33.375
“Things have changed.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:36.535
I won’t be going on to university,” I told them.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.215
They both stared at me in disbelief.

00:02:39.785 --> 00:02:43.025
“Today, I received grave news from my homeland, Ankhazastan.

00:02:44.585 --> 00:02:47.585
My father has been murdered by a political enemy.

00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:48.375
Poisoned.”

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:51.235
They gasped and stared at me.

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:55.735
Elizabeth took my hand and George put his hand on my shoulder.

00:02:56.315 --> 00:03:02.955
Their faces showed pity, and Elizabeth… well, I was never any good at reading emotions.

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:08.265
“A car is waiting and I am going to leave Hemsworth immediately.

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:12.475
After the assassination, the situation there is unstable

00:03:12.795 --> 00:03:15.815
and I need to be there to get things under control.

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:17.205
They need me.”

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:22.045
“You’re the new President?” George asked, in awe.

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:26.105
“In three weeks’ time, when I turn eighteen,” I said.

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:30.515
“And I promise you this, I will reform Ankhazastan.

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:35.645
Under my leadership, it will become a thriving and peaceful nation.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:40.805
In time, I will bring democracy and freedom in full measure.

00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:45.725
In time, justice and the rule of law will thrive.”

00:03:46.515 --> 00:03:50.495
George said, “If anyone can do it, you can, Miki.”

00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:56.015
“Sorry, there’s no time for a proper goodbye, but I hope you’ll visit.

00:03:57.545 --> 00:04:03.835
Give me time to take charge of the situation and I’ll invite you both to visit in the near future.”

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:07.935
It was a promise that would take five years to keep.
