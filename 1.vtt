Episode 1, George.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.470
I first met Miki when we were both sixteen years old.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.530
We were both students at Hemsworth College, one of the most prestigious schools in England.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.930
I had been a boy there since I was thirteen, but Miki joined just for sixth form, when he was 16.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:27.823
And, although I’m English – you can tell from my name, George,

00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:34.353
Miki was from a small country in central Asia called Ankhazastan.

00:00:34.353 --> 00:00:38.973
Geography was probably my worst subject and I had never heard of the place.

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:48.356
Miki was tall, good-looking with dark brown, wavy hair, charming and extremely intelligent.

00:00:48.986 --> 00:00:53.286
And he oozed confidence – and that was helpful when we

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:56.496
sneaked out of school to go and drink in the local pubs.

00:00:57.126 --> 00:01:02.046
Any barman would take one look at me and immediately ask my age.

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:07.736
But Miki would walk casually up to the bar and confidently order a beer

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:13.866
for me and a vodka for himself – he passed for eighteen every single time.

00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:22.593
It was one of these evenings in the pub when I had just met Miki, when I found out about his father.

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:28.903
It must have been over thirty years ago now, but I remember it like it was yesterday.

00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:35.342
A local yob – muscles, tattoos, bald head – wandered

00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:39.003
up to our table and addressed Miki aggressively.

00:01:40.853 --> 00:01:41.643
“I know you.

00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:43.452
I’ve seen you in the paper.

00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:45.673
You’re Demetriev’s boy.”

00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:50.433
“Indeed you’re correct!” replied Miki.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:56.863
His cultured, well-enunciated English contrasted with the yob’s rough accent.

00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:00.213
The yob pressed on.

00:02:00.802 --> 00:02:02.563
“Your dad’s a dictator, innit?

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.443
A real piece of work, the paper said.

00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:08.163
He locks up anyone who doesn’t like him.

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:10.213
Probably tortures them too.

00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:12.343
What do you say about that?”

00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:18.642
Miki just smiled in his easy going way and said, “I’m

00:02:18.642 --> 00:02:21.523
happy to hear that you’re interested in Ankhazastan.

00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:26.753
Yes, it’s true we’re not a democracy, but we don’t torture people.

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:28.443
Why don’t you sit down?

00:02:28.913 --> 00:02:31.793
I’ll buy you a beer and I can tell you all about it.”

00:02:33.543 --> 00:02:39.543
Miki gestured at an empty chair next to him, and the yob stared at it for a moment.

00:02:41.133 --> 00:02:43.003
“Nah, mate,” he replied.

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:44.923
“You can buy me that beer though.

00:02:45.463 --> 00:02:52.773
I’ll be over there.” I was amazed at how smoothly Miki had handled the situation.

00:02:53.643 --> 00:02:56.003
I wished I had his easy confidence.

00:02:57.873 --> 00:03:02.453
When Miki returned from the bar, I asked him what all that was about.

00:03:03.503 --> 00:03:08.582
I was shocked to find out that he really was the son of a dictator.

00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:16.693
Miki described his father as a “benign dictator”, something like Julius Caesar.

00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:21.153
“ Are you the eldest son?” I asked.

00:03:22.912 --> 00:03:25.462
“The only son,” he replied.

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:30.622
I stared at him in amazement and admiration.

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:32.712
“That means…”

00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:35.732
“ Yes,” he said.

00:03:36.372 --> 00:03:40.362
“That means that one day I’ll be ruling Ankhazastan.”
