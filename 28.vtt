00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.650
Episode 28.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.490
Genera Menetev

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.440
c

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.040
Miki was shouting and ranting…again.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.379
“The Western way is not the right way for us,” Miki was saying, “They invest.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.310
They make money.

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:18.779
Then they complain.

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.619
They send spies.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.210
It’s now clear to me that all they want is for Ankhazastan to be in DEBT to them.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.050
Their slaves!

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.900
“We will do it OUR way.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.760
We will build our nation in the way that we want and with our money – it

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.000
may take longer, but we won’t be slaves to corrupt Western bankers.

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.480
“I’m going to unveil a new five-year plan.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.089
We’re finally going to build the Ankhazastan we want to build.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.120
There will be big changes, I warn you.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.390
The key is Plan Zero.”

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.180
I glanced at the others and looked down at the table.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.000
We all knew what Miki’s Plan Zero was… invade Armagnia, capture their

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.060
oilfields that had been “stealing our oil”, neutralise their tiny

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:17.820
army using nerve gas and use the oil money to develop Ankhazastan.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:29.936
It would work except for one factor… Armagnia was   full of US troops who had recently arrived.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:34.586
The US President had said in no uncertain terms that an attack

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:39.686
on Armagnia would be treated like an attack on the United States.

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:42.516
something Miki refused to accept.

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:48.376
It’s why I had a plan of my own… hidden right under this table.

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:53.886
If he mentions Plan Zero one more time…, I thought…

00:01:54.996 --> 00:01:57.886
“More changes,” Miki continued.

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:02.186
“General Topov, you are no longer in charge of the Ministry of

00:02:02.196 --> 00:02:06.276
Finance - you will be deputy, reporting to my friend George.

00:02:06.806 --> 00:02:09.596
General Anitiv, you are no longer head of Foreign

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.666
Affairs and you will report to my friend Elizabeth.

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:14.666
With immediate effect.”

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:17.746
What madness was this?

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:22.536
Topov and Anitiv said nothing, the worms!

00:02:23.216 --> 00:02:28.666
They just stared down at the table, but I could see the anger burning in their eyes.

00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:34.306
“We’re going to be a superpower now,” Miki said, “and

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:39.536
other nations should take us seriously… but they don’t.

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:45.316
There’s only one way to make that happen… Plan Zero.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.349
I'm going to launch an attack on Armagnia, and I'm going to do it tomorrow morning

00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:55.151
There was only one way.

00:02:55.871 --> 00:03:00.753
I felt under the table for the button that I had installed earlier, wired to five

00:03:00.773 --> 00:03:05.933
kilos of plastic explosives placed under the table next to where Miki always sat.

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:08.273
That’s it, I thought.

00:03:08.863 --> 00:03:10.153
I’m going to do it.

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:13.443
Hopefully, I’ll die in the explosion, too.

00:03:14.253 --> 00:03:16.393
And I pressed the button.

00:03:18.103 --> 00:03:22.933
There was a small flash and some smoke… but no explosion.

00:03:23.683 --> 00:03:28.723
Miki was stunned, and then he scanned the table, looking for the traitor.

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:33.493
I felt sick to my stomach and avoided his gaze.

00:03:34.043 --> 00:03:39.843
But then, five of the other generals suddenly stood up and produced weapons.

00:03:40.343 --> 00:03:45.483
Topov shocked me by stepping forward and pointing his pistol directly at Miki’s head.

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.213
“You’re hereby under arrest,” he said.

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:49.573
“It’s over.”

00:03:50.323 --> 00:03:53.663
Miki just stared in shock as another general produced a pair

00:03:53.663 --> 00:03:57.083
of handcuffs, twisted his hands behind his back and cuffed him.

00:03:58.053 --> 00:04:00.563
“Are you out of your tiny minds?” Miki spat.

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:03.693
“I’ll have you all executed for this.”

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:07.943
And I breathed a sigh of relief.

00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:15.643
Miki had pushed us too far and I seemed like I wasn’t alone in being prepared to stop him.
