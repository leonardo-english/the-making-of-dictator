Episode 2, Elizabeth.

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.679
When I was a teenager at Hemsworth College in the early 1990s, my best

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.879
friend was a boy called George, slightly nerdy and from a wealthy family.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:22.779
And then, when we were all around sixteen years old, a new boy joined our school.

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.419
His name was Miki and he was from a small country called Ankhazastan.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:34.589
You wouldn’t know it from his English though – he spoke as if he grew up in Buckingham Palace!

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.189
George quickly became great friends with Miki.

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:42.829
I think he was inspired by Miki’s charming nature.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:45.519
He was just so self-assured.

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:51.029
George, of course, wanted all three of us to hang out together and be friends.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.939
I was keen, but several of the other girls warned me.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:04.029
People had quickly realised who Miki was, or rather, who his father was.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.279
“He comes from some kind of backwards country.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.899
His family all live in huge palaces while the common people starve.”

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:18.609
“It’s not even a democracy.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:24.619
It’s communist or something, and they shoot people who complain about it.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:28.369
And nobody is allowed to leave.”

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:34.929
So I decided to find out for myself – by asking Miki.

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:41.369
After classes, I found George and Miki sitting on the lawn behind the school building.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.349
Miki was smoking a cigar, just as carefree as you like.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.899
“You’re not allowed to smoke, you know,” I told him.

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:54.542
“ Elizabeth!” Miki exclaimed.

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:58.967
He was so handsome with his dark piercing eyes.

00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:02.537
Maybe that’s why the girls didn’t want me to be friends with him.

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:03.827
They were jealous!

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:09.457
“Miki,” I said, “I’ve been hearing a lot about you.”

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:13.787
“Good things or bad things?” Miki asked casually.

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:19.777
“Well, err…,” I could feel myself falling victim to his charm,

00:02:20.227 --> 00:02:26.567
“Just that, you know, your dad is a dictator and things like that.”

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:32.667
I giggled nervously, and George rolled his eyes and looked away.

00:02:33.057 --> 00:02:34.437
I ignored him for now.

00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:37.947
Miki turned and faced me.

00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:40.187
“I’m an open book, Elizabeth.

00:02:40.437 --> 00:02:41.967
Ask me anything you like.”

00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:50.467
“Well,” I began, “Lydia said that you live in a huge palace while your citizens starve.”

00:02:51.156 --> 00:02:57.866
Miki laughed and said, “Yes, we live in a palace, and yes, we have poor people in our country.

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.636
The same as your British Royal Family.

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:04.076
Our people are poor, yes, but starving?

00:03:04.086 --> 00:03:04.636
No.”

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:10.416
“Yes, but…” I decided to try a different tack.

00:03:10.836 --> 00:03:15.816
“Well, Vicky said that your country is supposed to be a communist country,

00:03:16.076 --> 00:03:21.316
so you…, I mean, it’s hypocritical to be so rich and live like that.

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:24.046
And you don’t let people leave the country.

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.486
…According to Vicky, I mean.”

00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:29.446
He paused for a minute.

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:32.746
He had the most beautiful eyes.

00:03:33.517 --> 00:03:36.117
“ My goodness!” Miki exclaimed.

00:03:36.537 --> 00:03:40.097
“It seems some of your friends need to brush up on their geography!

00:03:40.457 --> 00:03:44.887
We’re not a communist country – we’re a kingdom, like Saudi Arabia

00:03:44.947 --> 00:03:48.847
or Britain, in a way, but with a president instead of a king.

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:53.427
We’d love for all of our people to be rich, which is why we’re trying

00:03:53.427 --> 00:03:58.287
to develop our oilfields – if we succeed, we’ll be richer than England!

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.600
“ And we’re quite a small country, so most people have never met anyone from Ankhazastan.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.280
I suppose that’s where the rumour started that people can’t leave.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.500
Of course they can!”

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.050
“I see…” I replied, half-convinced.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.600
“Well, I’m glad we got that out of the way.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:25.990
”
Miki smiled, then said cheerfully, “George told me that you like the pop group Toneboys.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.230
Do you know I’ve met them?”

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.839
“ Yeah?” I said, perking up.

00:04:32.864 --> 00:04:36.204
“ They performed at our country’s Independence celebrations.

00:04:36.534 --> 00:04:39.204
Sit down and I’ll tell you all about it.”

00:04:40.744 --> 00:04:42.614
He’d met the Toneboys?

00:04:42.964 --> 00:04:48.254
All the talk about evil governments was forgotten, and I sat down, eager

00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:53.604
to hear his stories and learn more about this fascinating new friend.
