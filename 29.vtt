Episode 29, George.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.349
Elizabeth and I had no idea why we were arrested and

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.539
brought to a farmhouse on the outskirts of Anhaz.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.540
Wasn’t the letter from Miki enough?

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.250
Why were we being held at a house and not a prison?

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.710
After several hours of being held at gunpoint, a general came to explain.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.470
“I’m General Setiev,” he informed us.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.290
“I’m holding you here for your own protection while a special operation takes place at the palace.”

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.470
“It’s a coup!” Elizabeth exclaimed.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.210
“Well…” said Setiev cautiously, “If everything goes

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.500
according to plan there will be a change in leadership.”

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.700
“And then you’ll let us go free…?” I asked

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.930
“No,” he said, without emotion.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.180
“Then you’ll be put on trial, found guilty and executed.”

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.469
My blood ran cold.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.580
“What if…” I said, “what if… the coup doesn’t succeed?”

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.089
“Then I’ll be executed!” laughed Setiev.

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:29.449
And he motioned for a soldier to bring vodka.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.820
We drank vodka with the general in silence for over an

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.210
hour, and then he received a call on his cell phone.

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.050
“Da, da…” he said, smiling into the phone.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.179
Then he turned to me and said, “Sic semper tyrannis.”

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.370
It’s a Latin phrase that we learned at Hemsworth.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.960
It means, “and thus for all tyrants.” The coup was successful.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.970
We spent three more days in custody at the farmhouse..

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:12.903
I just couldn’t stop thinking about our execution.

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:15.633
Would it really end this way?

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:22.913
But on the third day, Setiev returned with news.

00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:26.673
“President Topov has changed his mind - you’ll be freed.

00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:33.173
You’ll be able to visit Miki one last time and then you’ll leave the country and never return.

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:38.253
You will tell British newspapers that you were treated well and spared”

00:02:40.823 --> 00:02:44.893
I hugged Elizabeth and we both burst into tears.

00:02:46.293 --> 00:02:49.943
“Here are your phones,” Setiev told us, handing them over,

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:55.443
“You can read all about what happened on your BBC and CNN.

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.503
We leave in ten minutes.”

00:02:59.273 --> 00:03:03.523
We both grabbed our phones, eager for news of Miki and the coup.

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:10.113
But before I got to the news, I noticed I had an urgent message.

00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:18.267
It was from London, but from someone with an Ankhaz name…  Mikitiv
