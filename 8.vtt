00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.592
Episode 8, Elizabeth.

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:11.222
As we entered the huge oak doors to Miki’s personal office, I didn’t know what to expect.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:20.922
But there he was, the same old Miki, sitting behind a massive desk and smoking a cigar.

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:28.872
As soon as he laid eyes on us, he jumped up, ran over and gave us both massive hugs.

00:00:30.382 --> 00:00:35.552
“Oh, my God!” he said, “It’s so good to see you two!

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:39.045
“ Why didn’t you write to say you were coming?

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.765
I would have met you at the airport with a limo.”

00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:49.455
“There’s no postal service between the UK and Ankhazastan,” I said, laughing.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:54.615
“Next time, just go to our embassy in London, and

00:00:54.615 --> 00:00:58.515
they’ll forward any messages to me,” he chided gently.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:05.865
“Nabikiv, you old fool!” he barked, “Bring some vodka and three glasses!”

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:09.005
Drinking at eleven o’clock in the morning.

00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:12.275
This was still the old Miki, all right.

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:19.935
We drank and we chatted; soon, we were transported back to our Hemsworth days…

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:27.165
just three old friends talking about old times, and a couple of hours flew past.

00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:34.075
After some time, our talk turned to… difficult topics.

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:42.405
“Miki,” I said, “your palace is wonderful, but the rest of the country is…”

00:01:42.658 --> 00:01:45.518
“ Falling to bits?” he laughed shyly.

00:01:45.878 --> 00:01:51.138
“Yes, but it’s not like I can sell my palace and that’ll fix the entire country.

00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:52.828
You have to be realistic.

00:01:52.888 --> 00:01:56.678
And people expect a certain status from their leader.

00:01:57.138 --> 00:01:58.558
It’s the culture here.”

00:02:00.128 --> 00:02:05.978
“A leader needs a symbol of power”, George agreed, “But what about reforms?

00:02:06.018 --> 00:02:08.928
Remember what you said the last time we met?”

00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:12.408
“ Reforms are coming,” Miki assured us.

00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:16.228
“After my father’s poisoning, we uncovered a group that

00:02:16.248 --> 00:02:20.348
wanted to destabilise the country – communists and anarchists.

00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:24.778
We entered what we called the Special Crisis Period.

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:30.548
“ The SCP lasted until now – it ends officially next week, in fact.

00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:34.718
It took us five years to hunt down and arrest all of the members.

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:37.778
Reforms were impossible until now.”

00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:43.318
“None of this was reported in the Western press,” I pointed out.

00:02:43.738 --> 00:02:48.318
“I always looked for stories about you and Ankhazastan and there was nothing!”

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:53.418
“They’re more worried about ‘Y2K’,” Miki laughed.

00:02:54.978 --> 00:03:00.858
“Were they… executed… these communists and anarchists?” George asked.

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:04.568
“Some,” Miki said gravely.

00:03:04.898 --> 00:03:06.918
“It was the decision of the courts.

00:03:07.528 --> 00:03:08.968
I didn’t interfere.

00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:12.678
Heavy is the head that wears the crown, as they say.”

00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:18.068
“But you’re still committed to reforms…,” I prompted.

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:22.958
“Starting next week!” Miki announced proudly.

00:03:23.308 --> 00:03:28.218
“We’ll shift gears from the Special Crisis Period to the Special Reform

00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:33.288
Period, starting with free Internet access to all citizens of Ankhazastan!

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:38.888
Anyway, enough politics, I want to hear how you guys have been doing…”

00:03:40.308 --> 00:03:45.888
We spent the rest of the day chatting, dining and touring the palace grounds.

00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:47.938
It was wonderful.

00:03:49.548 --> 00:03:54.818
I still had feelings for him, and I’m pretty sure the feeling was mutual.

00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.841
But with George here, we never had a moment alone.

00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:04.477
Besides, I knew it might be another five years before I saw him again.
