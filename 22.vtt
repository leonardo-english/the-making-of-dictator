Good evening and welcome to News at Eight with me, Leon Thomas.

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:23.358
In tonight’s news: MI6 accuses Ankhazastan of developing chemical weapons.

00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:28.198
After becoming the golden boy of investors over the past few years,

00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:34.078
President Miki Unjonginiv of Ankhazastan has shocked the world once again.

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:39.928
News at Eight has received a dossier from MI6, Britain’s intelligence service,

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:45.798
showing spy satellite photos of what looks like a chemical weapons facility.

00:00:46.468 --> 00:00:49.878
The findings have been confirmed by the CIA.

00:00:50.938 --> 00:00:54.898
I’m joined in the studio today by regional expert Sally Orlov.

00:00:55.248 --> 00:00:56.308
Sally, welcome.

00:00:56.598 --> 00:01:00.158
How could Ankhazastan – a poor and technologically

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:04.258
backward country – have developed these weapons so quickly?

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:06.557
Good evening, Leon.

00:01:06.877 --> 00:01:08.767
The answer seems pretty simple.

00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:12.287
Some of the investment money that they have received to build infrastructure

00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:16.807
like the new airport and new roads must have been diverted to weapons research.

00:01:17.797 --> 00:01:21.517
This comes on the heels of erratic behaviour by Miki – he

00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:25.387
threatened to invade at least one of his neighbours, didn’t he?

00:01:26.147 --> 00:01:27.307
That’s correct, Leon.

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:30.627
He later claimed that it was just a drunken joke, but

00:01:30.627 --> 00:01:33.327
this dossier will send shockwaves through the region.

00:01:33.737 --> 00:01:36.927
And Miki’s erratic behaviour – such as engaging in polygamy

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:40.077
with five wives – certainly doesn’t help to build trust.

00:01:40.637 --> 00:01:44.687
At least one of the neighbouring countries, Armagnia, has asked the United States

00:01:44.697 --> 00:01:48.537
for help and the President is considering having “boots on the ground” there

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:52.817
to control the situation and protect their own oil interests in the country.

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:58.327
Now, Sally, all foreign investment in Ankhazastan has been channelled

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:01.897
through a British investment firm by the name of WhiteRock.

00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:05.887
Surely, they must be feeling the heat right now.

00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:08.357
Has the CEO made a statement?

00:02:09.397 --> 00:02:12.857
Not yet, Leon, but a press conference is scheduled for tomorrow.

00:02:13.247 --> 00:02:18.277
The CEO is George Fitzwilliam-Pembroke, who is apparently an old schoolmate of Miki’s.

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:21.157
He’ll certainly have some tough questions to answer.
