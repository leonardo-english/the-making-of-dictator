Episode 24, Elizabeth.

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:09.109
George and I arrived in Ankhazastan on a cold Monday morning.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.449
It was our third trip but this one would be different.

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.669
After George’s humiliation by the media, and Miki’s marriage

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.489
to five women, we were both unhappy with things in Ankhazastan.

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:30.279
Our first stop, as always, was the Presidential Palace.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.379
As we stepped through the grand entrance and were led to see Miki, I

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:40.739
asked George, “Do you think he’s going to turn on the charm again?”

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.819
George just smiled and said, “It’s Miki, what do you expect?”

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.489
“My great friends!

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.379
So lovely to see you!” was his greeting as he called for a bottle of Chateau Latour.

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:05.649
It was difficult to stay upset with Miki in his presence, and I know George felt the same way.

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:09.469
We longed to chat with him as friends, like in the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.079
old days, but we all knew business had to come first.

00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:20.659
“Things are falling apart, Miki,” said George, “What are we going to do?”

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:26.929
Miki took the bottle of wine from his butler and poured out three glasses.

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:31.229
“As it happens, I do have a plan.

00:01:31.379 --> 00:01:35.729
It’s quite radical - are you ready for it?” he smiled.

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:39.449
I sipped nervously on the wine.

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:44.389
Perhaps his radical plan would involve him divorcing his five wives.

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:51.559
“Okay,” he said, “Here it is: both of you stay in Ankhazastan!

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:57.129
George, you will be the Minister of Finance and Investment.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.369
Elizabeth, you will be the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.769
You can begin new lives here and you will even be

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.899
able to keep me under control when I get too drunk!”

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.899
It was a completely ridiculous idea.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.319
And yet…

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.289
Miki must have known that my marriage wasn’t exactly

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.919
Romeo and Juliet and my career had hit a brick wall.

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.599
So why not, I thought to myself.

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.589
It would be a new life, a new career, new opportunities…

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:40.363
But I knew not to show my cards too early

00:02:41.103 --> 00:02:43.803
.
“We’re here for a week, Miki,” I said.

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:45.533
“It’s a no for now.

00:02:45.863 --> 00:02:48.803
If things change, I’ll let you know before we go”

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:56.193
“Alright,” Miki said, “Let’s enjoy our time together and you can think it over.

00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:58.863
We will discuss this again on Friday.”

00:03:00.543 --> 00:03:07.563
But George was more gung ho, or at least he wasn’t as good at hiding his emotions as I was.

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:11.973
I could see the look of excitement on his face.

00:03:12.183 --> 00:03:17.883
He was ready to give everything up and become part of Miki’s experiment.

00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:25.543
“I think it’s a fantastic idea, Miki,” he said, holding out his glass for a refill of wine.

00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:28.133
“I think we could really make it work!”

00:03:29.743 --> 00:03:37.243
That was George, gullible, easily tricked by Miki, and always rushing into things.

00:03:38.913 --> 00:03:44.483
But had he forgotten our plan to meet a certain person the following day?
