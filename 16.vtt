Episode 16, George.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.899
When we landed at Ankhaz airport, we were sad to see that it was even more run down

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.969
than before, with paint peeling off the walls and a stench coming from the toilets.

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:24.070
But, to be fair, that was why Miki asked me to come here – to help get money to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.220
build a new airport and develop the oilfields so that he could develop the country.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.379
Once again, there were only three or four other passengers on the

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.150
plane and we were waved through immigration after showing our visas.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.190
But this time, Miki had arranged a driver for us, and as we

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.560
stepped outside, we saw two stocky men in uniforms waving to us.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.770
They were standing next to what looked like a Russian Lada with an Ankhaz flag planted on the front.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.269
“I am Sergiv, your driver,” the first man said, holding out

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.390
his hand for me to shake, “and this is Andrev, my assistant.”

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.660
“Why does a driver need an assistant?” I muttered to myself.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.140
Sergiv seemed to understand me and chuckled, but avoided answering my question.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.060
“Please,” he said, holding the door open for Elizabeth.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.730
As she got in the car, he explained, “Miki will meet you at 5 o’clock.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.990
I will take you to the palace and you can rest first.”

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.840
I looked at my watch.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.590
It was midday, local time.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.940
“Since we’ve got time to kill, why don’t we drive around for a bit?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.899
We could stop off and try some of the local food,” I suggested.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.540
Sergiv said something to Andrev and Andrev replied with a single

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.389
word, ‘nyit’, which I guesed must have been ‘no’ in Ankhaz.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.670
“No,” Sergiv told us.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.739
“We go straight to palace.”

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.149
However, Elizabeth shocked me by reaching over and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.780
grabbing the steering wheel before Sergiv could drive off.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.239
She produced a photo of the both of us with Miki – from our last trip – and showed it to the men.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.280
“It’s a simple request,” she said.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.570
“We want to go somewhere in the city and try the local food.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.720
I’m sure Miki wants to hear that you made us comfortable.”

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.279
Andrev’s face became crimson red, but he nodded to Sergiv and off we went.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.820
The city of Ankhaz was completely dilapidated.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.329
The road was full of potholes and even Miki’s propaganda posters were fading.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.739
Finally, we arrived at a small, shabby café.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.220
I knew that the driver and his “assistant” wanted to make a good impression.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.260
Was this the most pleasant place they could find?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.520
As we went inside, all conversation stopped and the other diners looked down at

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.989
their food, refusing to make eye contact as soon as they saw Andrev’s uniform.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.630
The two men ordered us coffee, cabbage soup and a beef stew, something like a goulash.

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.230
The coffee was awful, but the food was surprisingly tasty.

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:38.740
When Andrev was in the toilet, I took the chance to go outside unaccompanied for a smoke.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.530
There, I tried to engage people in conversation.

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.090
“Good afternoon,” I said to a man passing by.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.030
He stopped and looked at me, then he looked behind me, a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.359
look of panic appeared on his face and he hurried away.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.620
I turned around to see Andrev standing there with his arms crossed.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.450
Who was this guy?

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.260
He was no “assistant”, that was for sure.
