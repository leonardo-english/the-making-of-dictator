00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:02.792
Episode 6, Elizabeth.

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:07.832
We couldn’t fly directly to Ankhazastan; we had to fly

00:00:07.852 --> 00:00:11.272
to Vladivostok and catch a smaller plane from there.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:17.462
There were only four other people on the flight – two businessmen and two military types.

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:24.272
It was a cold and damp afternoon when we landed at Ankhaz, the capital.

00:00:24.762 --> 00:00:29.122
It was a big old airport, but completely deserted.

00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:34.872
We wandered nervously up to the one immigration counter that was open.

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:38.072
We had been told by the embassy in London that we

00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:42.162
didn’t require a visa – our letter from Miki was enough.

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:49.242
The woman at the counter stared at the letter, surprise showing momentarily

00:00:49.252 --> 00:00:55.232
in her eyes, then waved us through without even stamping our passports.

00:00:55.802 --> 00:01:00.192
I noticed, also, that there was not even a computer on her desk.

00:01:01.852 --> 00:01:05.742
“It really is a bit of a shambles, isn’t it?” commented George.

00:01:06.112 --> 00:01:07.862
I could hardly disagree.

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:14.382
We exited the airport through the huge doors and looked for a taxi.

00:01:14.772 --> 00:01:17.472
There weren’t any, not even one.

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:19.442
We stared at each other.

00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:22.492
What had we gotten ourselves into?

00:01:24.132 --> 00:01:28.352
There were two armed soldiers near the entrance and George approached them.

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:32.302
A moment later he came back and reported: “They’ll call

00:01:32.302 --> 00:01:34.832
a taxi for us, but it’ll take an hour to get here!”

00:01:34.832 --> 00:01:39.712
To kill time, we exchanged some money.

00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:44.352
We each exchanged a hundred-pound note and received three

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:48.712
bundles of notes in return, each the size of a brick.

00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:52.812
The smallest note was 10,000 Ankhaz Rubles.

00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:58.082
“They must have an issue with runaway inflation,” George said.

00:01:59.842 --> 00:02:06.482
We bought two coffees – 200,000 rubles each – and waited outside for our taxi.

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:09.642
It took one and a half hours to show up.

00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:15.892
During that time, we counted only six people entering or leaving the airport.

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:22.262
“Russkia?” asked the taxi driver, helping us with our bags.

00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:25.642
“No, British,” I said.

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:27.332
“Do you speak English?”

00:02:29.012 --> 00:02:30.712
“Yes,” he replied.

00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:32.462
“Ver’ good English.

00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:37.082
Just like Queen of England.” And he laughed at his own joke.

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:42.232
“ Okay,” I said, “Take us to the biggest hotel in town.

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:43.172
The biggest.

00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:44.882
How much for the trip?”

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:52.572
The driver replied by holding up his thumb and forefinger, leaving a gap of about two centimetres.

00:02:55.822 --> 00:02:55.852
“What?

00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:58.372
No, how much MONEY for the taxi?”

00:03:00.022 --> 00:03:03.172
The driver motioned for me to pass him my money; then

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.292
he took about two centimetres of notes from the stack.

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:10.622
“Ankhazastan money no good,” he grinned.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:18.352
As we drove away from the airport, we passed a huge banner with Miki’s face on it.

00:03:18.652 --> 00:03:23.702
He was gazing handsomely into the distance and there was some text underneath.

00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:28.602
“What does it say?” I asked the driver.

00:03:30.182 --> 00:03:32.152
“Miki love Ankhazastan.

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:37.442
And Ankhazastan love Miki,” he replied without any emotion.

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:43.282
“That man, Miki, is an old friend of ours,” I told him.

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:49.502
Upon hearing that, the driver’s face turned sour, and

00:03:49.502 --> 00:03:52.552
he didn’t speak to us for the rest of the journey.
