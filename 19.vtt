Episode 19, George.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.760
It took all of my concentration to avoid the potholes

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.820
on the abysmal highway to the north of Ankhazastan.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.409
Meanwhile, Elizabeth kept glancing at the side-view mirror.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.660
For the past hour, we had been discussing whether or not to help Miki and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.010
we had come to the conclusion that we should – we had given our promises.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.280
And I suppose we each had our reasons.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.750
“Do you think that grey car is following us?” Elizabeth asked suddenly.

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:37.480
“How would I know?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.620
The cars here all look the same,” I replied.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.659
There were only a few cars on the highway, and they were all

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.199
grey and all the same design, based on a Soviet-era Lada.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.300
We stopped at one of the few petrol stations, and Elizabeth’s grey car passed us and drove on ahead.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.760
“Just me being paranoid, I guess,” Elizabeth commented.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.520
About twenty minutes later, we pulled into the town of Borokov, our destination, and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.270
we drove to the shabby but picturesque town square and parked near the old clock tower.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.039
There was a small café with a group of labourers dining al fresco.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.169
They were wearing drab clothes and enjoying a simple lunch and, of course, some vodka.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.360
As we sat down, we could feel everyone staring at us.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.120
Outsiders.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.400
When we asked in English for a menu, all conversation

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.590
stopped and the waitress just stared at us blankly.

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:52.619
But a man who had sat down just after us said, “May I help you to order?” in flawless English.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.569
“I recommend the bishbirmik – meat and pasta.”

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.460
“Thank you so much; we’ll take it, and two coffees,” I said, “and can

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.940
you translate for us if we ask some questions to the people here?”

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.690
“My pleasure,” said the man with a wide grin.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.000
He seemed better dressed than the others, as if he was also a visitor to the village.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.610
What’s more, the villagers seemed just as surprised to see him as I was.

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:29.930
“I just want to ask them if they’re happy with the way things are going in Ankhazastan,” I said.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.299
The man turned to the men and said something in Ankhaz.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.140
One of the group gave a short and curt reply.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.550
“They say life is a little hard but they are optimistic for the future,” the man translated.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.849
But there was an older man who had obviously drunk more vodka than the others, and he

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.109
said something with a bit more passion, slapping the table with his hand as he said so.

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.119
I heard Miki’s name mentioned.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.389
“He said that, er…” our translator struggled briefly, “he said that he works hard and some

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:16.989
of his money is taken by corrupt LOCAL officials, but President Miki is going to fix this.”

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.190
Oh, I’m sure that’s what he said, I thought.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.439
I had also just noticed a grey car parked just around the corner of the opposite street.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.390
I didn’t mention it to Elizabeth because she might make a scene.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.380
“Is it true that there is a huge prison near this town?” she asked.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.430
This time our translator replied directly.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.899
“No,” he laughed.

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.720
“Just the town jail where they put drunks like this old guy.”

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.100
I sighed.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.040
Something was wrong here, but it might be wise not to ask too many more questions.
