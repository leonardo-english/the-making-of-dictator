Episode 3, George.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.780
All good things come to an end and so it was with our schooldays.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.380
I remember one lazy afternoon when Miki, Elizabeth

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.820
and I were sitting on the lawn in front of the school.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.660
Elizabeth was looking pretty in her summer dress and Miki was smoking a cigar, as usual.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.709
Graduation was only a week away.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.980
“I don’t know what’s wrong with Cambridge,” Elizabeth was saying.

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:37.379
“It would be so nice if you guys were there with me.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.600
But no, you’re going off to Oxford”, she said, looking at me, “and Miki to Harvard.”

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:52.826
“ Elizabeth,” I said, “my father went to Oxford and my grandfather and my great-grandfather.

00:00:53.356 --> 00:00:55.066
It’s basically my destiny.

00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:59.496
Remember, I’m being groomed for a role in the family business.

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:04.086
If I don’t go to Oxford, they’ll let my little sister take my place.”

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.926
“Girl power!” Miki chipped in.

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:11.486
“I’ve always believed that women make great and strong

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:14.876
leaders – like your Thatcher and your Queen Elizabeth.”

00:01:16.116 --> 00:01:22.546
He loved making comments about Britain; it was something I always found very funny about him.

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:28.716
And then he continued, “Elizabeth, unfortunately, I don’t

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:32.986
have a little sister, so it’ll be up to me to run things.

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.176
George is being groomed for his family business.

00:01:36.736 --> 00:01:40.466
I’m being groomed to run my entire country.”

00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:43.996
Elizabeth and I both perked up.

00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:49.686
Miki didn’t often talk about his future as the president of

00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:53.956
Ankhazastan and we were always interested to hear about it.

00:01:55.256 --> 00:01:58.576
“What sort of leader are you going to be?” I asked him.

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.306
“A great leader!” he said.

00:02:02.836 --> 00:02:05.836
“I’m going to Harvard – not because I don’t like

00:02:05.846 --> 00:02:09.266
England – but to see politics from their point of view.

00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:13.566
Harvard has excellent courses in politics and economics.

00:02:14.116 --> 00:02:16.376
I need to be knowledgeable in these things.”

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:22.266
“And what about introducing democracy?” asked Elizabeth.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:30.626
Miki took a long drag of his cigar, held the smoke in his mouth for some moments and exhaled.

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:35.916
“If all goes as planned, Ankhazastan will become a democracy,

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:39.636
I’ll make sure of it”, he said, looking up at the sky.

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:44.236
“I’m so happy to hear you say that,” said Elizabeth,

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:48.136
who always seemed more interested in politics than me.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:55.176
Miki stood up and said, “My father is still young, just forty years old.

00:02:55.576 --> 00:02:58.756
Whatever changes I make are far in the future.

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:01.106
Harvard is my immediate goal.

00:03:01.576 --> 00:03:03.316
That’s my main focus for now”

00:03:04.496 --> 00:03:07.846
We stood up and walked with him towards the school buildings.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:13.836
The headmaster was up ahead, looking the opposite way, but turning in our direction.

00:03:14.296 --> 00:03:20.336
So I snatched Miki’s cigar out of his hand, threw it on the ground and crushed it with my heel.

00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:24.426
“Why did you do that?” he said darkly.

00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:28.226
He never liked it when things were taken away from him.

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:34.126
“If you get caught smoking again, you’ll be expelled, and you know that,”

00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:41.106
I told him, scolding him lightly, but also admiring his carefree attitude.

00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:45.366
“Rules are for other people,” said Miki.

00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:46.736
“Not for me.”
