Episode 14, Elizabeth.

00:00:04.225 --> 00:00:07.875
I was shocked when George told me he had spoken to Miki on the

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:12.675
phone… and he had even agreed to fly over there and meet with him.

00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:16.765
He had insisted that the protest outside the embassy was

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:22.295
unimportant and that Miki was willing to talk about social change.

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:30.085
I expected my own phone call from Miki, and I got it a few days later at my office.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:36.105
“Hello, my darling Elizabeth,” he began, knowing full

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:40.395
well how I wasn’t exactly impervious to his charm.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.490
“   How is your work going?”

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.060
“ Nice to hear from you, Miki,” I said.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.420
“Work is fine.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.380
I’m still doing public relations work for Detsi Cola and Fresh FM.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.690
Nothing so grand as running an entire country!”

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.600
Miki continued, “And I hear there are wedding bells on the horizon.”

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.160
My face turned red, even though it was silly to blush on the phone.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.020
If things had turned out differently, it could have been Miki and me…

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.370
But I pushed those thoughts out of my head.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.130
Derek was a great man, he was a safe pair of hands.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.910
It might not be fireworks, but we’d surely be happy together.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.400
“I’d love to invite you to the wedding, Miki, but you never leave Ankhazastan.”

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.900
Miki laughed and said, “Elizabeth, I heard that your

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.100
firm does PR work for the Prime Minister’s Office.”

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.850
“Yes, that’s true,” I said, “But that’s the juiciest contract, and it’s handled by the boss’s son.”

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.600
“The juiciest contract?” repeated Miki.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.460
“Well, how about this for a juicy contract… handle Ankhazastan’s PR over there, in Britain.”

00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:06.333
“Miki!

00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:09.763
" I laughed, "The UK press thinks that you’re ‘Dr.

00:02:09.793 --> 00:02:10.443
Evil’.

00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:17.343
The best PR for you right now is no PR – just don’t do anything that causes these headlines.”

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:20.273
“ I disagree,” said Miki.

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:26.013
“Ankhazastan needs foreign investment, and for that, we need positive

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:30.803
headlines… or at least neutral ones that stick to the facts.”

00:02:31.773 --> 00:02:33.523
“ Facts?” I replied.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.013
“But you really did those things.

00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:43.213
For example, you really did pass repressive laws against the LGBT community and environmentalists.”

00:02:44.683 --> 00:02:46.423
Miki had an answer for this.

00:02:46.743 --> 00:02:51.773
“Maybe it’s seen as negative over there, but it’s very popular with our people.

00:02:51.993 --> 00:02:55.773
In a survey we did, 93% were in favour.

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:59.533
They’d have rioted if we hadn’t passed such a law.”

00:03:01.003 --> 00:03:02.403
“Okay,” I said.

00:03:02.723 --> 00:03:06.053
“What about the law that stops people from becoming millionaires?”

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:10.483
Miki had an answer for this, too.

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:12.823
“It’s an anti-corruption measure.

00:03:12.913 --> 00:03:20.163
99% of millionaires in Ankhazastan became rich through cheating people and taking bribes.

00:03:20.423 --> 00:03:23.113
But your press didn’t say anything about that.”

00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:27.829
Something is wrong with your country I thought.

00:03:27.903 --> 00:03:33.953
if people can only get wealthy through corruption . But I kept this thought to myself.

00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:38.933
It wasn’t as if all of the clients my agency worked for were squeaky clean…

00:03:40.593 --> 00:03:45.213
Miki continued, “And actually, a few of your Labour MPs said

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:49.363
it was a positive move, but that didn’t get reported either.

00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:54.843
This is why we need PR – we just want balanced reporting, so that

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:59.703
investors don’t get scared off and so we can really develop the country.

00:03:59.913 --> 00:04:03.743
Then, we can have more openness, more democracy.”

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.353
I sighed.

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:12.923
I didn’t want to get mixed up in Miki’s political affairs, but he was very persuasive.

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:19.723
“And what’s more,” Miki said, “I will match the fees paid by the Prime

00:04:19.723 --> 00:04:25.473
Minister’s Office and I will insist that you handle the contract yourself.”

00:04:27.053 --> 00:04:29.093
This caught my attention.

00:04:29.523 --> 00:04:34.223
The chance to be a rising star in my PR firm, some international

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:37.863
travel and the chance to spend more time with Miki.

00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:39.603
I couldn’t say no.

00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:45.383
“I’ll fly over there and we can discuss it in person,” I told him.

00:04:45.713 --> 00:04:49.723
“And I’m sure George would be more than happy to tag along”.

00:04:51.263 --> 00:04:53.153
And that was settled then.

00:04:53.723 --> 00:04:56.973
I would be making another trip to Ankhazastan.
