Good evening and welcome to News at Eight with me, Leon Thomas.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.810
Our main story tonight: Leader of Ankhazastan makes waves with controversial new laws.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.940
Four years after eliminating all opposition and promising reforms, the President of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:38.060
Ankhazastan, Miki Unjonginiv has introduced a series of hardline new laws and policies.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.670
For starters, he has placed all national media under the direct control of the President’s office.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.190
Previously, any criticism of the ruler was extremely rare,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.430
but now the media is in the iron grip of the dictator.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.620
Secondly, he has made it illegal for any citizen to own assets over one million dollars

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.470
in value – and any “excess wealth” must be immediately handed over to the government.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.710
In practice, this will only affect a tiny minority of the population in this

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.370
impoverished nation that the US President referred to last month as a banana republic.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.210
What about Miki himself?

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.840
Although he lives a life of incredible luxury and privilege, technically

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.790
all of his money and assets belong to the state of Ankhazastan.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.940
Miki claims to be virtually penniless.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.860
Finally, in a move that will anger Western progressives,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.140
Miki has banned all LGBT and environmentalist movements.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.630
Simply wearing a t-shirt bearing a rainbow flag will now land you

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.020
in Ankhazastan’s infamous Borokiv prison for at least five years.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.890
I asked regional expert Sally Orlov why the sudden harsh new laws.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.420
“Hi Leon, thanks for having me on your show.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.680
“Four years ago, Miki allowed Internet access in Ankhazastan for the first time.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.820
For many people, this was a game changer.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.180
For the first time, they were exposed to outside ideas and opinions.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.830
As the Internet has become more advanced, websites have popped up

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.950
criticising the Ankhaz government and especially its leader, Miki.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.540
“These new laws are basically a knee-jerk reaction to people

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.680
forming opinions that the government doesn’t want them to have.”

00:02:39.744 --> 00:02:40.174
“ I see.

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:43.784
And Sally, do people in Ankhazastan still have access

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:47.024
to the Internet, or has that been restricted, too.”

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:49.924
“Nobody knows, Leon.

00:02:50.444 --> 00:02:54.174
Foreign reporters are not allowed into Ankhazastan and the

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:57.294
government is in strict control of any information coming out.

00:02:57.784 --> 00:03:01.124
We suspect that the Internet is now censored… but nobody

00:03:01.174 --> 00:03:03.424
really has any idea what is happening over there.”
