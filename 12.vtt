Episode 12, George.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.750
The Embassy of Ankhazastan was located in a quiet part of south London.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.560
Well, it was usually quiet, but today there was a group of around sixty angry and noisy protestors.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.990
Some were holding signs with ‘Socialist Workers Party’ printed on the bottom.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.189
These guys were guaranteed to show up at any protest about anything.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.720
They were chanting, “Down with Fascism.”

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.089
Then, there were the LGBT protestors.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.150
I spoke to one of them briefly, a man with a slight build, holding a colourful rainbow flag.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.149
“I’ve heard rumours that Miki is gay, you know,” he told me, “He’s one of us’.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.890
This wasn’t getting me anywhere.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:03.980
Meanwhile, I spotted a small group of serious-looking men standing quietly to one side.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.180
One of them motioned to me to come over.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.649
“Are you a journo or something?” he asked me roughly.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.090
He was a tough-looking character with tattoos and muscles.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.380
“No, actually.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.380
I’m an old friend of Miki’s.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.940
I came here to see what all the fuss was about.” Immediately

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.589
after saying this, I wondered if it was a mistake.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.660
After all, most people here hated Miki.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.839
But the man pulled me aside and called his mates over.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.310
“Says he’s a friend of Miki’s,” he said to the others.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.100
“Any friend of Miki’s is a friend of ours.

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:46.419
As long as you can prove it, that is.”

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.970
I pulled out a now-faded photo of Miki and me at Hemsworth and showed it to the guys.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.370
They were visibly impressed.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.350
“Hemsworth, eh?

00:01:59.059 --> 00:02:03.689
Isn’t that that fancy school that millionaires send their kids to?”, he shot back.

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:10.199
“Something like that, yes”, I replied, eager to change the subject.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.749
“What is it that you like about Miki?” I asked them, now that I was in their good books.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.429
A second tough-looking fellow stepped up and spoke.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.850
He looked like a football hooligan.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.660
“Miki’s a tough, strong leader, not like the bunch of tossers running this country.”

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.109
The others nodded.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.699
He continued, “ What they won't print in the mainstream media is

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.309
the crime rate here compared to the crime rate in Ankhazastan.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.870
Things will never improve unless we have a strong leader… like Miki.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.730
“And look at these idiots,” he motioned to the protestors.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.139
“Gays and commies roaming the streets.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.280
You won’t get that in Ankhazastan.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.590
Alinur, you tell him.”

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.230
“I come from Ankhazastan,” said the young man.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.760
“My father, he brought me to London when I was fifteen.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.320
But in the UK, there are no morals.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.050
People just do whatever they want.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.529
It is rich country, but with no traditional values.”

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.080
The others nodded in agreement.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.840
“Are you guys part of some group?” I asked them.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.769
“Nah, mate, we’re just a bunch of regular lads,” the first

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.740
guy said, his friends chuckling and shuffling their feet.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.290
I found that hard to believe, but when I looked at the protestors, they also

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.100
had their agendas and none of them seemed to actually be from Ankhazastan.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.860
I really wanted to give Miki a chance, but whatever the truth was, I wouldn’t find it here.
