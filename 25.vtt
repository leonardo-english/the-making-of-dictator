Episode 25, Elizabeth

00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:08.511
“Haydiniv!” George said, “Long time no see.

00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:11.681
This is Elizabeth – the one who knocked the door and

00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:14.511
scared you away in the hotel all those years ago.”

00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:22.371
Haydiniv nodded his head, concentrating on driving away from the palace as quickly as possible.

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:29.621
He was a scruffy fellow with a shaggy beard and a nervous look – just how George had described him.

00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:37.247
“The truth is,” Haydiniv said, “ it’s a miracle that I’m not either dead or in prison.”

00:00:38.057 --> 00:00:43.797
He pulled over to the side of the road, jumped out, and quicker than a Formula

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:49.227
One team, he changed the licence plates on the front and back of the car.

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:59.127
As we drove off, he commented, “People say I’m paranoid, but it’s my paranoia that keeps me alive.”

00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:03.927
George had kept Haydiniv’s phone number all of these

00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:07.537
years and we had long been planning to meet him.

00:01:09.057 --> 00:01:14.727
Of course, if Haydiniv had heard that George and I were about to get into bed with

00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:21.517
Miki, that we were future ministers, he probably wouldn’t be so keen to meet us!

00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:28.397
As George began debating politics with Haydiniv, I tuned out

00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:32.597
in the backseat and stared at the countryside flashing by.

00:01:32.907 --> 00:01:38.127
My thoughts turned to daydreams about the future - Miki was struggling

00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:42.787
to turn the country around, but the three of us together could do it!

00:01:43.274 --> 00:01:49.814
With my background in PR, I would be well-suited to a position as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:56.004
I would deal with world leaders on a daily basis and fly to Washington to meet Obama…

00:01:57.614 --> 00:02:05.084
Perhaps, in time, I would become the First Lady of Ankhazastan… I could see the statues

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:12.194
of me by Miki’s side… We could even get a Nobel Prize if our reforms were successful…

00:02:13.784 --> 00:02:18.444
I snapped back to reality to find George arguing with Haydiniv.

00:02:18.844 --> 00:02:20.824
George was defending Miki:

00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:24.774
“I have known him for a long time.

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.164
He’s a good man.”

00:02:26.594 --> 00:02:30.754
While Haydiniv was describing Miki in the most brutal way.

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:33.764
“ He is terrible leader.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:36.864
He is thief and war-maker.”

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:42.077
“ You’re exaggerating,” said George, “and as for being

00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:45.697
a warmonger, I suppose you’re going to show us proof?”

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:50.514
“ YES”, said Haydiniv with great determination.

00:02:50.914 --> 00:02:52.834
I will give you proof.

00:02:53.234 --> 00:02:58.214
We drive for one hour and I will give you proof.”
