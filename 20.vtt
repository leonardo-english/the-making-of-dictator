Good evening and welcome to News at Eight with me, Leon Thomas.

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:20.221
In the headlines tonight: President Miki of Ankhazastan

00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:25.351
shocks the world with a surprise marriage and outburst.

00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:31.011
President Miki Unjonginiv of Ankhazastan, now 35 years old, has

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.271
apparently decided that it’s time to tie the knot and settle down.

00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:41.411
So far, so good, but Miki has shocked the world by becoming groom to not

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:48.381
one, but FIVE blushing brides, all between eighteen and twenty years of age.

00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:56.711
In a further shocking twist, Miki gave a drunken speech at his wedding banquet where he threatened

00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:04.471
to INVADE neighbouring countries and – as he put it – take back the oil that belongs to him.

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:12.141
I’ve invited regional expert Sally Orlov to the studio to help explain the situation.

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:16.071
“Sally, for the past few years, it seems that there

00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:19.151
have been positive headlines coming from Ankhazastan.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:20.621
What happened here?”

00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:23.771
“Hi Leon, thanks for having me on your show.

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:25.301
“Yes, you’re correct.

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:29.301
After introducing a series of harsh laws which were criticised

00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:32.591
by the West, it seemed that Miki had changed his ways.

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:38.181
“Investment has been flowing into the country, and Miki opened a brand-new airport just last month.

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:43.141
We haven’t seen any negative news stories – but perhaps that is because any news

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:48.001
coming from Ankhazastan is strictly filtered through their PR agency here in London.”

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:52.231
“So, Sally, why wasn’t this news filtered?”

00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:57.767
“ Well, Leon, it’s simply getting harder to control information in the digital age.

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.067
Footage of the wedding was sneaked out on a USB

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:03.867
stick – ironically, probably through the new airport.”

00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:07.427
“And is polygamy legal in Ankhazastan?”

00:02:08.447 --> 00:02:09.637
“Nobody knows, Leon.

00:02:10.037 --> 00:02:12.557
Copies of the country’s laws aren’t available to us.

00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:15.497
We do know that polygamy is not normal there, though.”

00:02:16.227 --> 00:02:21.017
“ And do you see Miki living in matrimonial bliss with his five wives?”

00:02:22.047 --> 00:02:24.087
“Err… no, not really.

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:27.017
Plus, there are rumours that Miki is homosexual and that

00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:29.547
he married the women purely to kill off these rumours.

00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:32.747
Other people say he wants to have as many children as possible.

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:36.807
Others that he can’t stop talking about an English woman from his schooldays”

00:02:37.353 --> 00:02:37.823
“ I see.

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:42.293
And how serious are his threats to invade nearby countries?”

00:02:43.293 --> 00:02:45.173
“Again, Leon, nobody knows.

00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:49.643
Very few people have access to Miki and very few people know what he is thinking.

00:02:50.093 --> 00:02:53.103
It could be the vodka talking or it could be a real threat.

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:57.533
Nobody knows what size the Ankhaz army is or what weapons they have – but

00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:01.343
Ankhazastan is twice the size of its nearest neighbour, Armagnia.

00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:05.513
“Miki has claimed before that Armagnia has been ‘stealing’ oil from their

00:03:05.513 --> 00:03:09.183
shared oilfield, which runs deep under the ground of both countries.

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.253
So some people ARE taking the threat seriously.”

00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.361
“ One more question.

00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:16.401
Will this affect foreign investment?”

00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:18.791
“It certainly will, Leon.

00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:20.001
It certainly will.”
