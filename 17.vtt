Episode 17, George.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.990
I met Miki separately from Elizabeth.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.060
We wanted to get business out of the way before relaxing and catching up with each other.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.910
But first, I wanted to let Miki know that I wasn’t happy with his two “friends”.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.600
“You sent goons to pick us up from the airport!” I protested.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.639
“Come now, George,” Miki replied with his usual charm.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.940
“Okay, they’re a bit rough, those two, but they’re not goons.”

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.620
“If they’re not goons, why is everyone so scared of them?” I asked.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.220
“Andrev was in prison for eighteen years for murder,” Miki

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.010
explained, “but he found religion in prison and now he’s a good man.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.740
If people gave him a chance, they’d see him differently.”

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.190
It seemed more like they were afraid of his uniform than of

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.510
him, I thought to myself, but I accepted Miki’s explanation.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.349
“Let’s talk business,” I said.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:14.860
“You mentioned three projects – a new airport, a dam and a resort… and also the oil fields.”

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.479
Miki replied, “There’s a small problem with the oil fields at the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.870
moment, but, yes, as you’ve seen, we desperately need a new airport.

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:32.270
My feeling is that if we have a modern airport, more people will want to do business here.”

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.119
“Well…” I said, “Yes, it would help, but you need more than a new airport to attract business.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.229
Can I see your projections?”

00:01:44.313 --> 00:01:46.363
“ Projections?” Miki asked.

00:01:47.013 --> 00:01:53.383
“You know, your financial projections for how the new airport will impact the economy,” I prompted.

00:01:55.023 --> 00:01:56.433
Miki just stared at me.

00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:03.353
“You have some documents to show me for these projects, Miki, right?” I asked.

00:02:05.273 --> 00:02:11.603
For a few brief seconds, all of Miki’s charm and confidence left him, and he stared

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:15.703
at me like a little lost schoolboy who couldn’t answer the teacher’s question.

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:22.803
And I remembered how he had never been to university or been educated beyond high school level.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:27.153
He didn’t know the first thing about investments or large-scale

00:02:27.173 --> 00:02:30.429
infrastructure projects,   like building an airport.

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.099
And I guessed there was nobody in Ankhazastan who had the foggiest idea either.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:42.700
For those few seconds, I saw into Miki’s soul.

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:48.189
The charm and confidence were all a bluff, to hide the fact

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.109
that he was a little boy lost in a world he didn’t understand.

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.979
It felt good that I was the more assured one.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.529
“Miki, I will help you.” I promised, “I’ll send a team of my best people here for

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:08.709
a month and they will sort out everything we need to get these projects started.”

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:15.219
The confidence flowed back into Miki’s face and he was his old self again.

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:21.679
“George,” he said, reaching for a bottle of wine on his desk, “You

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:26.039
understand that business works differently in a country like Ankhazastan.

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:31.480
Some payments will have to be off the books if you know what I mean.”

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.379
Bribes, I thought.

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:40.859
My father had always avoided anything illegal… even if it meant lost business.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.329
But I wasn’t my father and I wasn’t going to lose an opportunity like this.

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:55.029
“I understand,” I said, as Miki poured out the wine, assuring me that everything would be fine.
